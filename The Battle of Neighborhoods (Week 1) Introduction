Introduction


Fredericton is the Capital City of the only Canadian bilingual Province of New Brunswick and is beautifully located on the banks of the Saint John River. While one of the least populated provincial capital cities with a population base of less than 60 thousand residents, it offers a wide spectrum of venues and is a governement, university and cultural hub.

As the city grows and develops, it becomes increasingly important to examine and understand it quantitiatively. The City of Fredericton provides open data for everyone and encourages entrepreneurial use to develop services for the benefit of its ciitzens.

Developers, policy makers and/or city planners have an interest in answering the following questions:

    1 What neighbourhoods have the highest crime?
    2 Is population density correlated to crime level?
    3 Using Foursquare data, what venues are most common in different locations within the city?
    4 Does the Knowledge Park really need a coffee shop?

Jeronimo wants to open his Burger Joint in some Locality (District) of Bogotá, Colombia.
And he is asking our help in finding the best Locality.

Business Problem 

In order to open Jeronimo's burger joint, we will have the need to use some information about the Localities in Bogotá.
We must be sure that the place where the burger joint is opened will have enough customers and also that there aren't a large ammount of burer joints in the place.
