To understand and explore we will need the following City of Fredericton Open Data:

      1 Open Data Site: http://data-fredericton.opendata.arcgis.com/
      2 Fredericton Neighbourhoods: http://data-fredericton.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/neighbourhoods--quartiers
      3 Fredericton Crime by Neighbourhood: http://data-fredericton.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/crime-by-neighbourhood-2017--crime-par-quartier-2017
      4 Fredericton Census Tract Demographics: http://data-fredericton.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/census-tract-demographics--donn%C3%A9es-d%C3%A9mographiques-du-secteur-de-recensement
      5 Fredericton locations of interest: https://github.com/JasonLUrquhart/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/master/Fredericton%20Locations.xlsx
      6 Foursquare Developers Access to venue data: https://foursquare.com/
      7 Using this data will allow exploration and examination to answer the questions. The neighbourhood data will enable us to properly group crime by neighbourhood. The Census data will enable us to then compare the population density to examine if areas of highest crime are also most densely populated. Fredericton locations of interest will then allow us to cluster and quantitatively understand the venues most common to that location.

- The Localities of Bogotá, Colombia from Wikipedia: https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anexo:Localidades_de_Bogot%C3%A1

- The coordinates (latitude, longitude) ot these Localities of Bogotá from Open Street Map APIs

- From Foursquare we will need following venues data:
  - the burger joint venues of the Localities
  - the offices venues of the Localities
  - the high schools venues of the Localities
  - the universities venues of the Localities

We will then leverage the data in order to determine which locality is the most appropriate in order to locate the burger joint.
